# NYC Landmarks Research Agent - Product Context

## Purpose & Vision

The NYC Landmarks Research Agent aims to democratize access to New York City's architectural and cultural heritage by creating an intelligent system that can generate comprehensive, accurate, and engaging research reports about NYC landmarks. This tool bridges the gap between vast amounts of landmark documentation and the people who seek to understand and appreciate these historical sites.

## Problems Solved

### Information Accessibility
- **Problem**: NYC has thousands of landmark documents containing valuable historical information, but this data is scattered across various databases and PDF reports, making it difficult for the public to access and comprehend.
- **Solution**: The agent consolidates information from multiple sources (vector database of landmark reports and structured metadata) to provide comprehensive answers to user queries.

### Research Complexity
- **Problem**: Conducting thorough research on NYC landmarks traditionally requires specialized knowledge and significant time investment.
- **Solution**: The agent simplifies this process by allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive well-structured, educational responses with proper citations.

### Contextual Understanding
- **Problem**: Standard search engines lack the ability to maintain context across multiple questions about landmarks.
- **Solution**: Conversation memory enables the agent to understand follow-up questions and provide contextually relevant answers that build upon previous interactions.

### Visual Context
- **Problem**: Text-only research lacks the visual context critical for understanding architectural landmarks.
- **Solution**: The agent includes relevant historical and modern photos in research reports to enhance understanding and engagement.
