# NYC Landmarks Research Agent - Progress Tracker

## Project Status: Initial Development Phase

The NYC Landmarks Research Agent is currently in the foundational development phase. We have established the core architecture and basic functionality, but several components need implementation or enhancement to meet all requirements.

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Project structure using FastAPI framework
- ✅ Configuration system with environment variables
- ✅ Docker containerization setup
- ✅ API router structure defined
- ✅ Basic error handling

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/research/generate` endpoint for report generation
- ✅ `/api/research/conversations/{conversation_id}` endpoint for history retrieval
- ✅ `/api/research/conversations/{conversation_id}` DELETE endpoint

### Client Integrations
- ✅ Basic structure for VectorStoreClient
- ✅ Basic structure for LandmarkMetadataClient
- ✅ Retry logic for external API calls

### Research Service
- ✅ Service layer architecture
- ✅ Basic research context building
- ✅ Integration with external clients
- ✅ Simple source document processing

## What's In Progress

### Client Implementations
- 🟡 VectorStoreClient implementation (basic functionality working)
- 🟡 LandmarkMetadataClient implementation (partial functionality)
- 🟡 AzureOpenAIClient implementation (needs optimization)

### Memory Service
- 🟡 Basic conversation memory structure
- 🟡 In-memory storage for development

### Research Generation
- 🟡 Basic research report generation
- 🟡 Prompt template design
- 🟡 Research context building

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality
- ❌ Complete CoreDataStore Vector API integration
- ❌ Complete CoreDataStore Landmark API integration
- ❌ Complete conversation memory implementation with TTL
- ❌ Enhance research report generation quality

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Landmark extraction from generated text (sophisticated implementation)
- ❌ Image integration and selection
- ❌ Suggested follow-up query generation
- ❌ Related landmarks recommendations
- ❌ Advanced filtering capabilities

### Production Readiness
- ❌ Redis integration for production memory storage
- ❌ Comprehensive error handling
- ❌ Logging and monitoring
- ❌ Rate limiting and throttling
- ❌ Security enhancements

### Testing & Documentation
- ❌ Comprehensive unit tests
- ❌ Integration tests
- ❌ Performance tests
- ❌ Complete API documentation
- ❌ User guide

## Known Issues

1. The `_convert_to_landmark_detail` method in LandmarkMetadataClient is incomplete and currently returns placeholder data
2. The landmark extraction from generated text is simplistic and needs enhancement
3. The suggested follow-up query generation is using a hardcoded approach
4. In-memory storage is not suitable for production deployment
5. Error handling needs improvement, especially for external API failures
6. Testing coverage is minimal

## Recent Progress Updates

### April 26, 2025
- Created project plan and documentation
- Assessed current codebase status
- Identified key implementation priorities
- Set up memory bank structure
- Created code quality automation script (scripts/lint_fix.py) for pre-commit checks

## Next Priority Tasks

1. Complete the `_convert_to_landmark_detail` method in LandmarkMetadataClient
2. Implement proper in-memory storage with TTL for conversations
3. Enhance landmark extraction from text
4. Improve research report generation quality with optimized prompts
5. Set up initial testing framework
